I've spent about 6 hours to set up this simple blog.

So what's the problem? If you're also interested in creating your blog on Github Pages, you may take my suggestion into consideration:

# Don't simply follow guidelines on jekyllrb.org

And yes, **Github Pages uses a different Jekyll engine**. (I mean, the beavior is a bit different.) If you follow those guidelines, Jekyll will works very well on your own machine, but just breaks on Github Pages:

**No you won't see them in the history of my website repository since I've deleted it.** So what's the point to create a Jekyll blog on Github Pages?

# Simply follow guidelines on github.com

Use this: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/

This will create the best experience for you both on your local machine and Github Pages. LOL Github just make things easier...

(Well of course I might have done something wrong during my first operation... but Github's way is really easier.)
