It's a pitty that nowadays people no longer write high-quality blog posts, but instead seek for acceptance by writing fragmented micro-blogs and WeChat moments. Notwithstanding, many of my friends still keep producing great ideas and write excellent blog posts. Here are some of them:

- [Haonan Bai](https://library.hoshimi.club), a schoolmate of mine.
- [Mingcong Bai](https://mingcongbai.wtf), maintainer of [AOSC OS](https://aosc.io), history scholar, great thinker.
- [Terence Lau](https://terenceliu98.github.io), a statistic and computer science ~~professor~~ expert.
- [Rainysummer Luo](https://rainysummerluo.github.io), a tech-savvy.
- [Zhenghao Wu](https://ecwuuuuu.com), a deep learning expert.
- [Junru Zhong](https://junru.dev), a computer science and transportation enthusiast.

This site is also included in [TUNA Blogroll](https://github.com/tuna/blogroll#lists), blogs in which are also full of great minds and are worth reading!
