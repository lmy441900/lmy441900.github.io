## GPG / PGP

I have switched my PGP key to a newly generated `ed25519 / cv25519` one, and I'm applying some best practices I learned after I've created my last PGP key.

- ~~My old key: `42F6 3E9D 68B9 884B 414D  4185 1029 4E7C 4008 E282`, has been revoked.~~
- My new key: `E6C7 4782 A1FB EE74 1D09  885F D274 286F 672C 800A`.

Fetch my key from [keys.openpgp.org][koo] or [SKS keyservers][sks] ([not recommended][sks-death]).

If you have signed on my old key, you can trust my new key since I've signed it with my old key in prior to the revocation. (Unfortunately this process is still not a best practice!)
