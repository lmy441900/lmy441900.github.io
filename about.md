I am a...

- Computer Science and Technology student in [Beijing Normal University - Hong Kong Baptist University United International College (BNU-HKBU UIC)][uic] in Zhuhai, mainland China.
- (Not-very-active) Developer at [Anthon Open Source Community (AOSC)][aosc], maintaining the AOSC OS MIPS64EL port.
- HAM (Amateur radio operator), level A (elementary), callsign **BI7PXN**

Blog posts are in English or Chinese, based on my mood.

My GPG key fingerprint is `42F6 3E9D 68B9 884B 414D  4185 1029 4E7C 4008 E282`. You can fetch my public key from ~~[Keybase][keybase]~~ _(Not recommended since I do not frequently update it)_ and [MIT PGP Public Key Server][mit-pgp]. Usually I will sign files, messages and codes (Git commits, tags) with the subkey `8F7C 924D D15F E3BA 317A  46E8 BAF4 0B91 0F4B 1346`, but my emails (Enigmail does that) and some of my previous codes are signed with my primary key. Just a reminder. You are welcomed to send me encrypted messages!

You can contact me over:

- [Telegram][tg].
- Email: lmy441900 at ...
  - Personal: live dot com
    - or gmail dot com (I may not check it frequently).
  - Work (AOSC and development related): aosc dot xyz.
- Radio (if I happen to be on any channel)!
