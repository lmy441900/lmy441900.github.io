I am currently a Computer Science and Technology student in [Beijing Normal University - Hong Kong Baptist University United International College][uic], which is in Zhuhai, mainland China. Developer at [Anthon Open Source Community (AOSC)][aosc], maintaining AOSC OS MIPSEL and MIPS64EL port.

My GPG key fingerprint is `42F6 3E9D 68B9 884B 414D  4185 1029 4E7C 4008 E282`. You can fetch my public key from ~~[Keybase][keybase]~~ _(Not recommended since I do not frequently update it)_ and [MIT PGP Public Key Server][mit-pgp]. Usually I will sign files, messages and codes (Git commits, tags) with the subkey `8F7C 924D D15F E3BA 317A  46E8 BAF4 0B91 0F4B 1346`, but some of my previous codes are signed with my primary key. Just a reminder. You are Welcomed to send me encrypted messages!

You can contact me over:

  - Work (AOSC and development related): aosc dot xyz

**THOSE SPAM EMAILS ARE NOW EVERYWHERE. They must have searched the OpenPGP keyservers (since there are emails on the UID).**
