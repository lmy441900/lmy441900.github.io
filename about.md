## GPG / PGP

I am planning to switch my PGP key to a newly generated `ed25519 / cv25519` one and apply some best practices I learned after I've created my last PGP key. The following are the two keys of mine:

- `42F6 3E9D 68B9 884B 414D  4185 1029 4E7C 4008 E282`: the old one.
- `E6C7 4782 A1FB EE74 1D09  885F D274 286F 672C 800A`: the new one.

I will start using my new PGP key as soon as possible, and I will keep the old key valid until **December 31, 2019**, after which I will issue a revoke certificate to it. If you have signed on my old key, you can trust my new key since I've signed it with my old key.
