Hi! I am Junde Yhi on the Internet, and my name in real life is Minyong Lee.

I am currently a Computer Science and Technology (pre-)student in [Beijing Normal University - Hong Kong Baptist University United International College][uic], which is in Zhuhai, mainland China. I am interested in computer programming and software designing. Also, I love playing football and table tennis, but not playing well :(

My GPG key fingerprint is `42F6 3E9D 68B9 884B 414D  4185 1029 4E7C 4008 E282`. You can fetch my public key from [Keybase][keybase], [MIT PGP Public Key Server][mit-pgp] or [This page][this-pgp]. Usually I will sign files, messages and codes (Git commits, tags) with the subkey `0xBAF40B910F4B1346`, but some of my previous codes are signed with my primary key. Just remind you. Welcome to send me encrypted messages!

You can contact me over [Telegram][tg], [Email][email] and WeChat (lmy441900).
